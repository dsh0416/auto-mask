  <h1> Auto Musk </h1>
  <p>
    The Concept is to Put Musks on Faces Automatically to Araise People's Awareness for Fighting COVID-19.
    The model is from TinyFaceDetector and TinyFaceLandmark 68, which is robust and could be run in browsers in a stable framerate.
    The model is loaded with face-api.js, which is a wrapper for Tensorflow.js on browsers.
    We made some linear algebra calculation to make the musk fit with the detected results.
